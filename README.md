Important note: I am currently working on recovering the Graphic User Interface (GUI) version I made using Python's Tkinter, since I lost the file due to unexpected events. I will update once I have successfully recovered the file.

Features:
1. Add: Lets user input a complete data of their income/expense records (category, description, and amount), which will then be saved in a records.txt file.
2. View: Shows user's current records along with the complete information for each records in a table, also with the current balance.
3. Delete: Lets user delete a record one at a time. Can handle deletion of duplicate records.
4. Change: Lets user change the record's information.
5. View Categories: Shows user the categories available in the program hierarchially.
6. Find: Find all records under a specific category or a subcategory specified by the user.
7. Save: Save the current records to records.txt file.
8. Exit: Exits the program.
